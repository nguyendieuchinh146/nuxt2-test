The success of eight tours to Can Gio and Cu Chi district, specifically arranged for over 1,000 healthcare staff during the epidemic, has prompted the company to expand its services. To ensure the safety of tourists, Saigontourist has partnered with Bao Viet Insurance to provide coverage in the event of a coronavirus infection during the tour. The tours to Can Gio are priced at VND1.6 million and VND680,000 per person, with weekend departures starting from October 15th.\r\n<br\/><br>\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Vietravel company has also resumed its tours to \"green zones\" in Ho Chi Minh City since October, adhering to a capacity limit of 50% for transportation and tourism services. The representative from Vietravel emphasized that this move not only contributes to the gradual restoration of the economy but also serves as valuable research to understand the demand and interests of travelers. This research will aid in developing appropriate tourism products for the future.\r\n<br\/><br>\r\n\r\nFurthermore, travel firms are encouraged to collaborate with relevant agencies to establish \"travel bubbles\" and design tours specifically tailored to the green zones, maximizing the potential for safe and enjoyable travel experiences.\r\n","img":"ho-chi-minh-city.jpeg","link":"ho-chi-minh-city-travel-firms-restart-tourism-services"},{"id":5,"title":"Hoi An Wins Asia\u2019s Leading Cultural Destination At World Travel Awards","content":"Hoi An has emerged victorious at the prestigious World Travel Awards 2021 (WTA) as it outshined renowned competitors including Beijing, Seoul, Kyoto, and Hue, securing its position as Asia's leading cultural city destination.\r\n<br\/><br>\r\nSince its inception in 1993, the WTA has earned the reputation of being the travel industry's equivalent of the esteemed Oscars, serving as a benchmark for assessing various categories in global tourism. Winners are determined based on the voting volume from both travel professionals and the general public.\r\n<br\/><br>\r\nLocated in the central region of Vietnam, Hoi An is an ancient city within Quang Nam Province.

Accessible through a scenic mountain pass, this enchanting valley showcases its unique charm in every season.\r\n<br\/><br>\r\nRenowned for its picturesque terraced fields, Muong Hoa Valley is a haven for Sapa enthusiasts. Whether during the lush green rice planting season or the golden harvest time, the valley never fails to captivate visitors. While many enjoy a mid-mountain hike to immerse themselves in this stunning vista, the true magic of the valley reveals itself when observed from a higher vantage point, allowing you to admire the meandering green trail amidst the fog.\r\n<br\/><br>\r\nThe introduction of the Muong Hoa mountain railway in 2018 has further enhanced the visitor experience. Stretching approximately two kilometers, this railway, one of Vietnam's longest, weaves through two tunnels and four viaducts, connecting Sapa Town to the Fansipan cable car station.\r\n<br\/><br>\r\nSeptember, in particular, is a spectacular time to witness Muong Hoa Valley's splendor. As the rice fields turn a vibrant yellow, the valley becomes a masterpiece crafted by nature and human ingenuity. From the soft morning glow to the enchanting sunset, the valley exudes vitality, freshness, and an ethereal charm. Nestled along the slopes are quaint houses that add to the valley's allure. What sets Muong Hoa apart is the harmonious blend of the Giay people's water rice planting technique in the narrow valley terrain and the groundbreaking methods employed by the Mong and Dao peoples in the high mountains, resulting in the breathtaking terraced fields.\r\n<br\/><br>\r\nFlowing gracefully through Muong Hoa Valley is a delightful 15-kilometer stream, which meanders through Lao Chai, Ta Van, Hau Thao, and Ban Ho communes. Known as Muong Hoa Stream, it originates from the renowned Bac Waterfall and is formed by the convergence of 22 streams originating from forests and mountain creeks. Along the banks, rattan bridges add a touch of charm, attracting tourists who seek to capture unique photographs.\r\n<br\/><br>\r\nAs you traverse the mountainside, you'll encounter an area adorned with intriguing carved stones. This four-kilometer-long and two-kilometer-wide section boasts at least 159 stones with mysterious images. In the past, numerous scientists from Vietnam, Russia, France, and Australia have explored this ancient site. These magnificent stones feature intricate carvings, depicting various human figures engaged in different positions and activities. Some display symbolic representations of reproduction worship, reminiscent of the Dong Son drum. With 11 distinct types of enigmatic human images, this extraordinary heritage is deemed a remarkable testament to mankind's artistic and spiritual legacy, captivating visitors as one of Sa Pa's alluring tourist attractions.\r\n<br\/><br>\r\nA visit to Muong Hoa Valley promises an unforgettable experience, offering a serene escape from the bustling center of Sa Pa. With its humble yet splendid beauty, this timeless valley remains a captivating testament to the wonders bestowed upon us by nature.\r\n","img":"muong-hoa-thung-lung-thanh-binh.jpeg","link":"discovering-beautiful-muong-hoa-valley"}]
